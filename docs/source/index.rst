Welcome to PlotVision's documentation!
======================================

PlotVision (`<plotvision.usask.ca>`_) is Software as a Service (SaaS) product for the analysis of agricultural unmanned aerialvehicle (UAV) imagery, developed at the Plant Phenotyping and Imaging Research Center (`<p2irc.usask.ca>`_) at the University of Saskatchewan. Users can upload UAV images of their research fields straight from capture. PlotVision then automatically analyzes crop colour, 3D shape and more, in order to help predict outcomes like harvest yield, disease resistance. Thus scientists can find the most viable pesticides, fertilizers, and crop varieties.
